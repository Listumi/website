        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 25, 2024</p>

        <p>Thank you for using Listumi. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
        <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Listumi is designed as a "local-first" application. All your shopping lists, product details, and preferences are stored locally on your device using SQLite database technology.</p>
        <p>We do not have access to your created content, and it is not uploaded to our servers unless explicitly stated otherwise for specific features.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We may use third-party services to improve the stability of our application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sentry:</strong> We use Sentry for error tracking and crash reporting. If the app crashes, Sentry may collect anonymous technical data (such as device model, OS version, and stack traces) to help us identify and fix the bug. This data does not include your personal shopping lists.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
