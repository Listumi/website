        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 29, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Listumi mobile application</strong> (herein referred to as "the App") and its associated website located at <strong>listumi.com</strong> (herein referred to as "the Website").</p>

        <p>The Service is provided by Listumi (herein referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service and is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1. Local Data (User Content)</h3>
        <p>The App operates on a "local-first" basis. Data such as shopping lists, product names, and preferences are stored exclusively on your device's internal storage (SQLite). We (the Service Provider) do not transmit this data to our servers and do not have access to it.</p>

        <h3>1.2. Automated Data Collection (Analytics & Logs)</h3>
        <p>To ensure app stability, we use third-party services that may collect information used to identify your device. This data is not linked to your personal shopping lists.</p>
        <p>Services used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sentry:</strong> Collects crash reports, device model, OS version, and stack traces to help us fix bugs.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics for Firebase / Google Play Services:</strong> May collect usage data (e.g., app open frequency, button clicks) and device identifiers (Instance IDs, Advertising IDs).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. GDPR Compliance (European Union)</h2>
        <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have specific rights regarding your personal data.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Basis for Processing:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> We process technical telemetry (via Sentry/Firebase) to maintain the security and stability of the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance of Contract:</strong> Local data processing is necessary for the App's core functionality (creating lists).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong> Since we do not store your personal data on central servers, you can exercise your "Right to Erasure" and "Right to Access" simply by accessing the data within the App or uninstalling the App, which deletes all local data.</p>

        <h2>3. CCPA, CPRA & CalOPPA (California Rights)</h2>
        <p>This section applies to residents of California.</p>
        
        <h3>3.1. "Do Not Sell or Share" (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
        <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong> We do not share your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising.</p>

        <h3>3.2. Sensitive Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We do not collect or process "Sensitive Personal Information" (such as geolocation, racial origin, or biometric data) as defined by CPRA.</p>

        <h3>3.3. Do Not Track Signals (CalOPPA)</h3>
        <p>We do not track our customers over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.</p>

        <h2>4. Children’s Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
        <p><strong>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13.</strong></p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information (e.g., via a crash report containing user input), please contact us so that we will be able to verify and take necessary actions.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Local data is retained on your device as long as the App is installed. Analytical data (logs) is retained by our third-party processors (Sentry/Google) for a limited period (typically 90 days to 14 months) before being automatically deleted.</p>

        <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
